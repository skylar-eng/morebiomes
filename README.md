# morebiomes
A simple mod adding extra biomes to Minetest Game

# luna
It is a desolate landscape composed primarily of gravel, silver sand and stone.
It is supposed to be kind of like a lunar landscape on Earth.

# floodbasalt
Flood basalt volcanic eruptions essentially are like floods of lava. Entire areas are covered in up to hundreds of feet of lava.
Some scientists even think flood basalt eruptions played a part in the extinction of the dinosaurs.
That's what this biome is.

# glassland
Yep. You read that right. Glassland is a biome, made of glass. It my evolve in the future. But right now it's just glass.

# coalfire
Have you heard about coal seam fires? There is a coal seam fire in, I think in Pennsylvania that will keep burning for 200 more years.
This biome is basically just a giant coal seam fire. Coalblock, on fire, underneath it is a large amount of coal ore. It will likely evolve in the future.

# pink
Pink. Nuff said. There's a surprise under the pink though.
This is largely a test biome. New features will be tested here, probably isn't suited for actual gameplay.
